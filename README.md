# solarsystem
This repository contains the code for our solar system VR project, being devoted to a realistic downscaled representation of the movements of the sun, the moon and the earth relatively to each other.


We ran into some issues regarding running a virtual machine on Azure to host the project, so instead here's a simple guide on how to run the project locally:
1. Download repository
2. Install Parcel by typing the following command: npm install parcel -g
3. Make sure to install dependencies: open project in VSCode -> open command line -> type: npm install
4. Run Parcel by typing this command: npx parcel ./src/index.html
5. Ppen your browser and copy paste this address http://localhost:1234
